# adaptive_learning_quiz
A demo quiz to show how adaptive learning works. 

The quiz first gives 2 easy level question and if the stuent is able to answer them correctly then the level of the questions is increased.
The one who answers all correctly will be solving 2 easy 2 medium and 1 hard question.

I have used PHP and MySQL for the backend.

Adaptive learning can have different interpretations. This is my interpretation.

In the video you can see that the level of the question changes according to the answer you give. If you give a correct answer the level increases and if you give incorrect answer the level remains the same.
