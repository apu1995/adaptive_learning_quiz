# adaptive_learning_quiz
A demo quiz to show how adaptive learning works. 

The quiz first gives 2 easy level question and if the stuent is able to answer them correctly then the level of the questions is increased.
The one who answers all correctly will be solving 2 easy 2 medium and 1 hard question.

I have used PHP and MySQL for the backend.

Adaptive learning can have different interpretations. This is my interpretation.
